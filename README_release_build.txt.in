Taking the concept of miniature golf to its logical extreme, in picoputt
your golf ball is a quantum particle.

How to play
-----------
Controls:
* Click and drag to putt.  The strength of the putt is determined by the
  distance between where you click and where you release the mouse.
* Scroll up and down (or use `[` and `]`) to adjust the radius of the
  putt-wave.  This changes the area of effect of the putt.
* Spacebar to measure position.  This will re-localize the particle.
* `R` to restart.
* `P` to pause/unpause.

As in classical golf, lower score is better, and putting adds 1 to your
score.  Measurement also adds to your score, but it only adds 1/2.
In other words: measure twice, putt once!

To win, you need at least 50% probability of finding the particle in the
local minimum energy state of the goal hole.

The location of the goal hole is indicated with a green arrow.  When the
ball is in the local minimum energy state of the hole, its probability
distribution will look like a stationary round bump at this location.
It may take some time for the drag force to slow the ball down enough to
reach sufficient probability in this low-energy state.

However, you may find that rather than a round bump, you instead get
"divots" in the ball's probability distribution which never go away and
prevent you from winning.  These are quantum vortices: annoying little
quantized bundles of angular momentum, which are not directly affected
by the drag force.  If you're having trouble dealing with vortices,
measurement can be useful tool to get rid of them.


Challenges
----------
If you need an extra challenge, here are some things you can try:
* Win without measurement
* Get a hole in 1
* Get a hole in 1/2 (very luck-based)
