How to play
-----------
To win, you need to reach a certain probability threshold of finding the
particle in the local minimum energy state of the goal hole.

This local minimum energy state will look like a stationary round bump
at the location of the hole.  You may need to be patient while the drag
force slows the ball down enough to reach sufficient probability in this
low-energy state.  However, you may encounter "dents" which never go
away, preventing you from winning.  These are quantum vortices: annoying
little quantized bundles of angular momentum, which are not directly
affected by the drag force.  If you're having trouble dealing with
vortices, measurement can be useful tool to get rid of them.

Controls:
* Click and drag to putt.
* Scroll up and down (or use `[` and `]`) to adjust the radius of the
  putt-wave.  This changes the area of effect of the putt.
* Spacebar to measure position.  This will re-localize the particle.
* `R` to restart.
* `P` to pause.

As in classical golf, putting adds 1 to your score.  Measurement also
adds to your score, but it only adds 1/2.

In other words: measure twice, putt once!
